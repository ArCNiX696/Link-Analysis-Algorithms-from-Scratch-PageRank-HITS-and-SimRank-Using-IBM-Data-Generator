ðŸ“Š Link Analysis Algorithms from Scratch: PageRank, HITS, and SimRank Using IBM Data Generator
Welcome to the repository for our Data Mining class project! This project involves the implementation and optimization of three fundamental link analysis algorithms from scratch: PageRank, HITS, and SimRank. Below, you'll find an overview of the project, key insights, and instructions to get started.

ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project delves into the implementation and analysis of three key link analysis algorithms:

PageRank
Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS)
SimRank
Using datasets generated with the IBM Data Generator, we evaluate algorithm performance across various network structures. Key experiments include:

Enhancing specific nodes' scores through strategic network modifications.
Analyzing the impact of algorithmic parameters such as damping and decay factors on results and computational efficiency.
ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
PageRank Algorithm: Used to rank web pages based on their importance by analyzing the quantity and quality of links. We explore its application on directed graphs and the impact of varying damping factors.

HITS Algorithm: Rates web pages as hubs or authorities, where good hubs link to good authorities and vice versa. We investigate strategies to amplify specific nodes' hub and authority scores through reciprocal link structures.

SimRank Algorithm: Measures similarity between nodes based on the principle that "two objects are similar if they are related to similar objects." We analyze its computational complexity and effectiveness with different decay factors.

ðŸ“Š Datasets
We utilize seven directed graph datasets for our analysis:

graph_1.txt
graph_2.txt
graph_3.txt
graph_4.txt
graph_5.txt
graph_6.txt
ibm-5000.txt
ðŸš€ Getting Started

ðŸŽ¨ Visual Insights
Throughout the project, various visualizations are created to illustrate the impact of different modifications and parameter adjustments on the algorithms' performance. These insights help to better understand the behavior and efficiency of each algorithm.

ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
This study affirms the significance of PageRank, HITS, and SimRank algorithms in extracting meaningful insights from network data. Each algorithm demonstrates robustness and adaptability in different scenarios, providing valuable contributions to the field of data mining and network analysis.
